# Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-In-College-Degrees

This repository contains the Python code to analyse data on the gender gap for 17 categories of degrees in US universities. The data, which is from The Department of Education Statistics, contains the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women in US from 1970 to 2012. Note that the data I use here was cleaned by Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania. The dataset is stored in the "percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv" file. Each column in the dataset represents a category of degree. 

Using visualizations by Python pandas package, we'll explore how we can communicate the nuanced narrative of gender gap using effective data visualization
